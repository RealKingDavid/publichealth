# Heart Disease Data Analysis Overview

### 1. **Import Libraries and Load Dataset**
The project begins by importing essential Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization. The heart disease dataset, containing key health metrics, is loaded for detailed exploration.

### 2. **Preview the First Five Records**
The initial exploration includes displaying the first five rows of the dataset. This provides a quick overview of the data structure and variables, including attributes like age, gender, and other health-related indicators.

### 3. **Examine the Last Five Records**
Similarly, the last five rows of the dataset are reviewed to confirm completeness and to detect any noticeable patterns or irregularities.

### 4. **Determine Dataset Dimensions**
The number of rows and columns in the dataset is identified, helping to understand its overall scale and complexity.

### 5. **Inspect Dataset Information**
A summary of the dataset is generated, showing the total number of records, columns, and their data types. This overview is critical for planning the data preprocessing steps.

### 6. **Assess Missing Values**
The dataset is checked for any missing values that could impact the analysis. Fortunately, no null values are found, confirming data completeness.

### 7. **Identify and Remove Duplicate Records**
A search for duplicate entries is conducted to ensure data quality. Any identified duplicates are removed to maintain the integrity of the analysis.

### 8. **Generate Statistical Summary**
A detailed statistical summary of the dataset is created, highlighting key measures such as mean, standard deviation, and percentiles. This helps to uncover patterns and trends within the data.
