The dataset is well-structured and ready for analysis without requiring imputation for missing data.
The target column shows a binary distribution: 0 (no heart disease) and 1 (heart disease).
A countplot visualizes the distribution, with more samples labeled 1.
The dataset appears slightly imbalanced, with a higher prevalence of heart disease cases. This could influence model training and evaluation in predictive tasks.
Cholesterol levels display a right-skewed distribution, suggesting that most individuals have moderate cholesterol levels, with fewer cases of extremely high values.
The dataset includes a wide age range, with most participants concentrated between 40-60 years.
Correlations can guide feature selection for predictive modeling. For instance, strongly correlated variables might provide redundant information.
Patients with specific chest pain types (cp=2) show a higher prevalence of heart disease, particularly in older age groups.
The model has decent performance, with an accuracy of around 80%.
It performs better at detecting heart disease cases (class 1) than no-heart-disease cases (class 0), as shown by higher recall for class 1 (87%) compared to class 0 (72%).
The precision for predicting no heart disease is relatively higher (85%), meaning when the model predicts no heart disease, it’s often correct, but it misses a few cases (29 false positives).
In practical terms, this means that the model is fairly good at predicting which patients are at risk of heart disease, but there’s room for improvement in predicting those who do not have heart disease.
